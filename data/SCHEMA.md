# Sigap AI — Dummy Dataset Schema

All rows are generated by the simulation-based synthetic data generator.
One row = one tick (1 simulated minute) × one intersection.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `timestamp_wib` | str (ISO +07:00) | Wall-clock WIB timestamp of the tick |
| `tick` | int | Zero-based simulation tick counter |
| `intersectionId` | str | Intersection identifier, e.g. `"SUR-4092"` |
| `approach` | str | Signal phase approach: `N`, `E`, `S`, or `W` |
| `vehicle_count_1min` | int | Vehicle arrivals in this 1-minute tick for the approach |
| `volume_veh_per_hour` | float | Derived: `vehicle_count_1min × 60` |
| `avg_speed_kmh` | float | Average speed (Greenshields model), km/h |
| `queue_length_veh` | int | Total queued vehicles across all approaches at tick end |
| `wait_time_min` | float | Estimated average wait time in minutes |
| `green_seconds` | int | Current green phase duration for this approach (seconds) |
| `density_percent` | float | Queue density as % of capacity (0–100) |
| `weather_condition` | str | One of: `Rain`, `Cloudy`, `Hot`, `Clear` |
| `weather_temp_c` | float | Air temperature in °C |
| `accident_count` | int | `1` if an accident is active this tick, else `0` |
| `roadwork_flag` | int | `1` if roadwork reduces capacity this tick, else `0` |
| `event_flag` | int | `1` if a special event causes a demand spike, else `0` |
| `target_volume_15m` | float | **Label** — predicted volume 15 minutes ahead |
| `target_volume_2h` | float | **Label** — predicted volume 2 hours ahead |
| `target_volume_4h` | float | **Label** — predicted volume 4 hours ahead |

## Notes

- Targets are computed by look-ahead over the generated time-series (not modelled separately).
- `density_percent` is the intersection-wide density, not per-approach.
- Rows with `accident_count=1` have reduced effective capacity (see `core/data_config.py`).
- Dataset is purely synthetic; no real sensor data is included.
- For ML training, use `target_volume_15m` as the primary label; `2h` / `4h` targets for multi-horizon models.
